# Linked List in Python

A type-safe, generic implementation of a singly linked list in Python.

## Description

The following is a sample implementation of a linked list data structure and the second entry into this collection of
Python data structures. I decided to complete this project for learning, practice, and a direct comparison to my 
[linked_list_C_example](https://github.com/AAM1130/linked_list_C_example/tree/master) project.

## Key Learnings

This project is a deliberate extension of the minimal implementation, attempting to handle creation of linked lists of
any common type. The module uses Python's static typing via type hints and generics to ensure type-safe and predictable 
behavior, if a type checker is enabled. This can make you feel like your fighting the type checker, but it also forces
you to directly consider the intent of the code. 


### Dependencies

* requires Python 3.10+ for:
    - 'TypeVar' and 'Generic' usage
    - Union syntax ('T | None')
    - Postponed evaluation of annotations

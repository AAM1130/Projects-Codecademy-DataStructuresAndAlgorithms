# Doubly Linked List in Python

A sample implementation of a doubly linked list in Python.

## Description

The following is a sample implementation of a doubly linked list data structure. I
decided to complete this project for learning, practice, and a direct comparison to
my [linked_list_C_example](https://github.com/AAM1130/linked_list_C_example/tree/master)
project. Despite the small difference of the double link, and the large difference in
language structure, all the core concepts of the data structure remain the same. This
implementation stores the Nodes as a class and not a structure, but the contents remain
functionally the same.

## Key Learnings

This project reinforced a fundamental concept I've been learning: that a variable is more
than just a name and a value. It's a reference to a location in memory. In a linked list 
hundreds of nodes long, if you need a value at a specific node, there is no name for that 
variable. The only way to access that variable is by following the references from the head
node. This small but fundamental difference in thought process leads to a deeper understanding
of what's happening 'under the hood' of your chosen programming language.
